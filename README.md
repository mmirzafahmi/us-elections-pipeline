# virginia_elections_pipeline
![Dagster Pipeline](docs/assets/pipeline.png "Virginia Elections")
This is a [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) project scaffolded with [`dagster project scaffold`](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/build/projects/creating-a-new-project).
The pipeline consists of 4 tasks,
1. Extraction: This node, extract data from Virginia (VA) bulk campaign finance data directory using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Once finish, the raw data will be stored in `data/` directory.
2. Concatenation: This node will all extracted data into one single file.
3. Ingestion: One combine data will be ingested to clickhouse data warehouse.
4. DWH: After the ingestion process is done, the landing table will be transformed to staging table which consists of the first three columns.

## Getting started

First, install your Dagster code location as a Python package. By using the --editable flag, pip will install your Python package in ["editable mode"](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs) so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then, start the Dagster UI web server:

```bash
dagster dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.

You can start writing assets in `virginia_elections_pipeline/assets.py`. The assets are automatically loaded into the Dagster code location as you define them.

## Development

### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Unit testing

Tests are in the `virginia_elections_pipeline_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest virginia_elections_pipeline_tests
```

### Schedules and sensors

If you want to enable Dagster [Schedules](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/automate/schedules/) or [Sensors](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/automate/sensors/) for your jobs, the [Dagster Daemon](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/deploy/execution/dagster-daemon) process must be running. This is done automatically when you run `dagster dev`.

Once your Dagster Daemon is running, you can start turning on schedules and sensors for your jobs.

## Deploy on Dagster+

The easiest way to deploy your Dagster project is to use Dagster+.

Check out the [Dagster+ documentation](https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-plus/) to learn more.
